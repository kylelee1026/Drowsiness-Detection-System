# Drowsiness-Detection-System
Drowsiness Detection System for Drivers

The purpose of the project is to prevent car accidents in advance which are caused by drowsiness of drivers. The project focused on how to perceive the drowsiness of human beings, especially for drivers. The system which applied to this project is entirely based on the camera vision and figuring out how it detects drowsiness from the driver's face. Basically, human beings represent a particular behavior when they feel drowsy: loose eyes and yawning. Thus, the Back-end system focuses on detecting the eyes and mouth on the human face, and how to determine whether the drivers are drowsy or not. Both characteristics are trained with over 30,000 raw human face images and it only extracts the eyes and mouth portions from the face by ‘dlib’, a general purpose cross-platform software library. The Front-end system is a mobile API with IOS(iPhone Operating System). By activating a camera on the iPhone, the application is processed with a designated user interface
